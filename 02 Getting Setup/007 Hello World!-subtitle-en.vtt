00:00.770 --> 00:06.200
In this video you are going to be creating and running your very first node app while it will be a simple

00:06.200 --> 00:11.510
one it's going to demonstrate the entire process from creating files to running them from the terminal.

00:11.510 --> 00:13.530
The first step is going to be to create a folder.

00:13.640 --> 00:17.030
Every project we create is going to live inside of its own folder.

00:17.150 --> 00:21.470
I'm going to open up the finder on OSX and navigate to my desktop.

00:21.470 --> 00:26.510
What I'd like you to do is open up the desktop on your OS whether you're on Linux or Windows or OSX

00:26.720 --> 00:32.450
and create a brand new folder called Hello world.

00:32.830 --> 00:35.940
Now I'm using capitalization on both the H and W..

00:35.940 --> 00:37.840
You could also go with something like this.

00:37.840 --> 00:39.470
Hello hyphen world.

00:39.910 --> 00:41.660
Let's go ahead and use this option.

00:41.680 --> 00:43.200
Hello hyphen world.

00:43.210 --> 00:50.350
In a lower case i don't recommend using spaces in your project file or folder names as it only makes

00:50.350 --> 00:54.060
it more confusing to navigate inside of the terminal.

00:54.070 --> 00:57.980
Now we have this hello world folder and we can open it up inside of our editor.

00:58.760 --> 01:04.460
Here I use command 0 to open up and I'm going to navigate to the desktop and a double click my hello

01:04.490 --> 01:08.370
world folder on the left I have my files which are none.

01:08.480 --> 01:10.380
Let's go ahead and create a new one.

01:10.610 --> 01:16.000
I'm going to make a new file in the root of the project and we're going to call this one app dot J.

01:16.040 --> 01:21.000
Yes this is going to be the only file we have inside of our node application.

01:21.200 --> 01:25.700
And then here we can write some code that's going to get executed when we start the app in the future

01:25.700 --> 01:29.510
we'll be doing crazy stuff like initializing databases and starting web servers.

01:29.510 --> 01:36.140
But for now we're simply going to use cons. dialogue which means we're accessing the logged property

01:36.140 --> 01:37.790
on the console object.

01:37.790 --> 01:38.520
It's a function.

01:38.540 --> 01:40.660
So we can call it with parentheses.

01:41.060 --> 01:46.410
And we're going to pass in one argument a string Hello world.

01:46.640 --> 01:50.260
I'm going to toss a semi-colon on the end and save the file.

01:50.270 --> 01:52.990
This is going to be the first app we run.

01:53.330 --> 01:59.120
Never remember there is a basic javascript requirement for this course so nothing here should look too

01:59.120 --> 02:00.110
foreign to you.

02:00.110 --> 02:04.330
I'll be covering everything new and fresh inside of this course but the basics.

02:04.380 --> 02:09.400
Creating variables calling functions those should be something you're already familiar with.

02:09.440 --> 02:13.700
Now that we have our out Jeff's file the only thing left to do is run it and we're going to do that

02:13.760 --> 02:15.410
over in the terminal.

02:15.410 --> 02:19.860
Now to run this program we have to navigate into our project folder.

02:20.270 --> 02:23.450
If you're not familiar with the terminal I'll give you a quick refresher.

02:23.450 --> 02:30.650
You can always figure out where you are using P.W. D on Linux or OSX or the dirty command on Windows

02:31.660 --> 02:34.200
when you run it you're going to see something like this.

02:34.210 --> 02:39.770
I'm in the Users folder and then I'm in my user folder and my user name happens to be Andrew.

02:39.850 --> 02:44.300
When you open the terminal or the command prompt you're going to star in your user directory.

02:44.320 --> 02:49.620
We can use C-D to navigate into the desktop.

02:49.870 --> 02:50.610
And here we are.

02:50.710 --> 02:53.190
Now we're sitting in the desktop.

02:53.210 --> 02:58.630
The other command you can run from anywhere on your computer is forwards slash user's forwards slash

02:58.720 --> 03:01.450
Andrew forward slash desktop.

03:01.460 --> 03:06.900
This is going to navigate to your desktop no matter what folder you're located in the command up above

03:06.910 --> 03:11.590
a CD desktop requires you to be in the user directory to work correctly.

03:11.620 --> 03:17.840
Now that we're here though we can start by seeding into our project directory which we called Hello

03:17.940 --> 03:25.180
hi hyphen world and once we're in here we can run in the ls command on Linux or Mac which is the dirk

03:25.180 --> 03:28.100
command on windows to see all of our files.

03:28.220 --> 03:30.290
And in this case we just have one we have app.

03:30.320 --> 03:30.770
DOT.

03:30.820 --> 03:31.320
J.S..

03:31.400 --> 03:33.930
This is the file We're going to run.

03:34.280 --> 03:37.540
Now before you do anything else make sure you see what I see here.

03:37.550 --> 03:40.830
You should be in the hello world folder and you should have the app.

03:40.850 --> 03:42.220
JS file inside.

03:42.230 --> 03:48.380
If you do all we're going to do is run the node command followed by a space so we can pass in an argument

03:48.800 --> 03:51.940
and that argument is going to be the file name app dot.

03:52.000 --> 03:58.550
Yes once you have this in place you go ahead and hit enter and there we go hello world prints to the

03:58.550 --> 04:03.870
screen and that is all it takes to create and run a very basic node application.

04:03.950 --> 04:09.020
While our app doesn't do anything cool we're going to be using this process of creating folders files

04:09.020 --> 04:13.640
and running them from the terminal throughout the course so it's a great start on our way to making

04:13.640 --> 04:15.480
real world node apps.

04:15.520 --> 04:19.340
That is it for this video and that is it for this section.

04:19.340 --> 04:24.890
We took a look at what node is why it's cool and you created your very first application and the next

04:24.890 --> 04:27.670
section we're going to dive in creating our first app.

04:27.770 --> 04:31.160
I am super excited to start writing real world applications.

04:31.190 --> 04:32.240
So stay tuned.

04:32.250 --> 04:33.840
I will see you next time
