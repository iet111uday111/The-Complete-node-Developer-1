00:00.560 --> 00:03.990
It before we started talking about what note is and why it's useful.

00:04.010 --> 00:05.850
Which I'm sure you are wondering.

00:05.940 --> 00:10.940
We're going to go ahead and install node on your machine because in the next couple of videos as I aim

00:10.940 --> 00:17.390
to answer those questions we're going to want to run a little bit of node code now to get started in

00:17.390 --> 00:20.330
this video we just need two programs a browser.

00:20.330 --> 00:24.070
I'm going to be using Chrome throughout the course but any browser will do.

00:24.140 --> 00:31.640
And in the terminal sometimes known as the command line on Linux or the command prompt on Windows.

00:31.730 --> 00:34.110
Let's go ahead and open that up right now.

00:34.430 --> 00:41.240
I'm going to use Spotlight to open up the terminal which is what it's known as on my operating system.

00:41.240 --> 00:45.860
If you're on Windows look for something like the command prompt you can search using the Windows key

00:45.860 --> 00:47.110
and then by typing.

00:47.210 --> 00:50.470
And on Linux you're looking for something called the command line.

00:50.660 --> 00:55.910
Although depending on your distribution it might be called the terminal or command prompt.

00:55.910 --> 00:59.670
Now once you have that program open you're going to see something a little daunting.

00:59.720 --> 01:00.580
It's a screen.

01:00.620 --> 01:04.260
Yours probably has a black background with white text.

01:04.400 --> 01:07.970
And essentially it's waiting for you to run a command.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.230
We're going to be running quite a few commands from the terminal throughout the course and then around

01:12.230 --> 01:13.510
four or five videos.

01:13.520 --> 01:15.220
I'm going to give you a crash course.

01:15.260 --> 01:19.410
So if you've never used this before you can start navigating comfortably.

01:19.670 --> 01:22.650
But for now you don't need to worry about any of that.

01:22.730 --> 01:26.210
We're not going to run any commands for the moment in the browser.

01:26.210 --> 01:32.780
We can head over to node j as dot org to grab the installer for the latest version of node and this

01:32.780 --> 01:38.070
course we're going to be using the most recent version of version 6 point 2.2.

01:38.150 --> 01:42.270
It is important that you install a v 6 version of Node.

01:42.360 --> 01:47.650
Yes it doesn't have to be a 2.2 it could be 1.0 but it is important.

01:47.660 --> 01:54.890
It's on that V-6 branch because there is a ton of new features that come along with it V-6 including

01:55.160 --> 01:59.710
all of the features you might have come to love in the browser or using iOS 6.

01:59.720 --> 02:03.890
This is the next version of javascript and it comes with a lot of great enhancements we're going to

02:03.890 --> 02:08.530
be using throughout the course this is Andrew from the future with a quick update.

02:08.540 --> 02:14.090
If you go over to node and J.S. dot org right now you're going to notice that things look a little different

02:14.090 --> 02:16.990
from what you're seeing in the video on the left hand side.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.610
We have these six in on the right hand side we have the eight.

02:20.690 --> 02:23.710
I recently updated this course to support the eight.

02:23.750 --> 02:27.030
So you can go ahead and download the latest version.

02:27.050 --> 02:30.090
For me it happens to be the 8. zero point zero.

02:30.170 --> 02:35.930
But if there are other versions out like the eight point 2.4 or something along those lines feel free

02:35.930 --> 02:38.390
to grab that as well.

02:38.390 --> 02:43.760
Now throughout the course you're not going to need a V-8 for most of the videos but near the end V8

02:43.880 --> 02:44.920
is going to be required.

02:44.960 --> 02:47.670
So I recommend just starting off with that right now.

02:47.780 --> 02:48.350
All right.

02:48.350 --> 02:50.910
Let's go ahead and get back in to the original video.

02:52.420 --> 02:55.150
For now though all we have to do is click this button.

02:55.210 --> 02:58.540
It downloads the installer and the installer is one of those basic.

02:58.540 --> 03:00.710
Click next a few times and you're done.

03:00.730 --> 03:04.730
Type of installers there's no need to run any fancy commands.

03:04.780 --> 03:08.140
I'm going to go ahead and start the installer here.

03:08.170 --> 03:10.080
It's just going to ask me a few questions.

03:10.090 --> 03:14.310
Go ahead and click next or continue through all of them.

03:14.380 --> 03:19.840
You might want to specify a custom and destination but if you don't know what that means and you don't

03:19.840 --> 03:25.660
usually do it when installing programs that go ahead and skip that step to here I can see I'm using

03:25.660 --> 03:27.010
just 47 megabytes.

03:27.010 --> 03:28.260
No problem.

03:28.330 --> 03:33.970
I'm going to go ahead and run in the installer by entering my password and once I enter my password

03:34.120 --> 03:37.670
it should really only take a couple of seconds to get node installed.

03:37.690 --> 03:38.530
And here you go.

03:38.620 --> 03:44.050
We have a message that says the installation was completed successfully which means we are good to go.

03:44.140 --> 03:50.290
And now that node has been installed successfully we can go ahead and verify that by running it from

03:50.290 --> 03:52.730
the terminal over inside of the terminal.

03:52.750 --> 04:00.230
I'm going to actually shut it down by going to quit terminal and open it up again.

04:00.570 --> 04:06.420
The reason I'm opening it up is because we've installed a new command and some terminals require a restart

04:06.450 --> 04:09.190
before it's going to be able to run that new command.

04:09.270 --> 04:12.920
In our case we've restarted things and we can run our brand new command.

04:12.930 --> 04:19.500
We're going to type it out just like this node space hyphen V.

04:19.920 --> 04:24.840
What we're doing here is we're running the node command and we're passing it what's called a flag.

04:25.020 --> 04:29.890
This is a hyphen sign followed by a letter could be a it could be J.

04:30.030 --> 04:31.810
Or in our case it's v.

04:31.830 --> 04:35.520
This is going to print the version of node currently installed.

04:35.550 --> 04:36.760
We might get an error.

04:37.670 --> 04:43.340
Like this if you try to run a command that doesn't exist like A.D SDF you'll see.

04:43.340 --> 04:44.800
Command not found.

04:44.810 --> 04:49.910
If you see that it usually means the node installer didn't work correctly or you haven't ran it in the

04:49.910 --> 04:51.190
first place.

04:51.230 --> 04:57.230
In our case though a running node with the V flag should result in a number in our case it's version

04:57.290 --> 04:59.320
six point two point two.

04:59.330 --> 05:03.520
Once again make sure that you have a V-6 version of node installed.

05:03.620 --> 05:09.080
Otherwise a lot of the videos throughout the course just aren't going to work if you do have node installed

05:09.320 --> 05:12.710
and you're seeing something like what I see here then you are done.

05:12.740 --> 05:17.240
I'll see you next time where we start exploring exactly what node is.

05:17.240 --> 05:17.990
Stay tuned.

05:18.110 --> 05:19.630
I will see you then.
