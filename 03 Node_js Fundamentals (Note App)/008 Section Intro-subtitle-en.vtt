Hello and welcome to Section 3 node fundamentals in this section you're going to be learning a ton about

00:06.920 --> 00:11.780
building node applications and you're going to actually build your first one a note application.

00:11.810 --> 00:14.000
This is where all the really fun stuff is going to start.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.510
We're going to kick things off by learning about all of the modules that come built into node.

00:18.620 --> 00:22.130
These are objects and functions and let you do stuff with javascript.

00:22.130 --> 00:23.840
You've never been able to do before.

00:23.870 --> 00:27.860
We're going to learn how to do things like read and write from the file system which we'll be using

00:27.890 --> 00:31.460
in the Notes application to persist our data.

00:31.460 --> 00:34.960
Now we're also going to be looking at third party NPM modules.

00:35.030 --> 00:38.400
This is a big part of the reason that node became so popular.

00:38.480 --> 00:44.180
NPM gives you a great collection of third party libraries you can use and they'll solve really common

00:44.180 --> 00:48.490
problems so you don't have to rewrite that boilerplate code over and over again.

00:48.680 --> 00:54.800
We're going to be using a third party module in this section to help with fetching input from that user.

00:54.800 --> 00:58.180
Now aside from all of that we're going to be looking at debugging broken apps.

00:58.190 --> 01:00.620
We'll look at some new iOS 6 features.

01:00.650 --> 01:06.020
It's all coming up now but we're going to kick things off talking about something called require
