Hello and welcome to section for a asynchronous node.

00:04.350 --> 00:05.020
Yes.

00:05.060 --> 00:10.910
Now if you've read just one article about Noad you probably come across four terms a synchronous nonblocking

00:10.970 --> 00:13.240
event based and single threaded.

00:13.370 --> 00:16.390
All of those are accurate terms to describe node.

00:16.400 --> 00:18.370
The problem is it usually stops there.

00:18.380 --> 00:19.800
It's really abstract.

00:19.850 --> 00:26.870
The goal in this section is to make that super practical by putting it all to use in our weather application.

00:26.900 --> 00:30.240
That's the project we're going to be building in this section and to get it done.

00:30.260 --> 00:33.570
We're going to need to make asynchronous HTP requests.

00:33.710 --> 00:36.000
We're going to want to fetch from two API.

00:36.020 --> 00:43.160
We'll be using Google's geo location API and we'll be using the dark sky API to take location information

00:43.370 --> 00:47.970
like a zip code and turn that into real world current weather information.

00:47.990 --> 00:53.910
Now in order to do all that we're going to look at callbacks promises HTP requests and more.

00:53.930 --> 00:59.360
Let's go ahead and dive right in looking at the very basics of async programming in node
