Welcome to the Course First up thanks for joining.

00:03.570 --> 00:07.000
I am super excited to show you everything that Noad can do.

00:07.020 --> 00:12.690
I packed this course with a ton of content projects challenges and real world examples all designed

00:12.690 --> 00:17.580
to teach you know by doing this means you'll be getting your hands dirty early on in the next section.

00:17.580 --> 00:22.110
Writing some code and you're going to be writing code for every project this is not one of those copy

00:22.110 --> 00:26.910
and paste courses you'll be writing every line of code that powers our applications.

00:26.910 --> 00:31.440
Now all of these projects are a ton of fun to build and they were designed to teach you everything required

00:31.440 --> 00:36.690
to launch your own node app from planning to development and testing to deploying.

00:36.750 --> 00:40.830
Now as you do launch these applications and move through the course you are going to run into errors.

00:40.830 --> 00:42.320
It's just going to happen.

00:42.390 --> 00:44.520
Maybe something doesn't install as expected.

00:44.520 --> 00:49.440
Or maybe you try to run an app and instead of getting the expected output you get a really long obscure

00:49.440 --> 00:50.100
error message.

00:50.100 --> 00:52.260
Either way I am here to help.

00:52.350 --> 00:55.730
At the bottom of every video you can find a link called Q&amp;A.

00:55.740 --> 00:59.010
This is going to link you to the Q and A section for that video.

00:59.010 --> 01:04.220
You'll be able to find other questions asked by other students and you'll be able to ask your own question.

01:04.260 --> 01:07.610
So if you get stuck post there and I'll get back to you right away.

01:07.770 --> 01:10.300
Let's go ahead and dive into the first section.

01:10.380 --> 01:14.470
Well you'll learn what note is why it's useful and you're going to write your first app.

01:14.520 --> 01:15.350
That's coming up next.

01:15.360 --> 01:16.350
So let's get to it.
